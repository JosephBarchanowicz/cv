# Overview & Goals {#karl-intro}
K.A.R.L. is my autonomous rover platform focused on reliable, field-friendly autonomy.
The goal is to combine a real-time control layer with ROS2-based perception and planning,
while keeping the system debuggable and maintainable for rapid iteration.

## Hardware Stack {#karl-hardware}
- **Chassis & Drive:** differential drive base with encoders
- **Sensing:** IMU, wheel encoders, optional LIDAR/depth camera
- **Compute:** SBC for ROS2 nodes + microcontroller for RTOS control loop
- **I/O & Buses:** CAN/SPI/I²C/UART as required
- **Power:** regulated rails with monitoring

## Software Architecture {#karl-software}
A layered approach: low-level motor control on RTOS (deterministic loop), with ROS2 handling
node graph, transforms, sensor fusion, and higher-level behaviors. Telemetry and parameters are
exposed over ROS2 topics/services for tuning.
